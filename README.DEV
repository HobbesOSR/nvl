After you have cloned the NVL repository, you are one step away from
being able to do development.

Devel vs. Full Devel Checkouts
==============================

The NVL includes various submodules (currently, Kitten and Palacios)
that are maintained in repositories separate from the NVL repository.
In a "devel" checkout of the NVL, these submodules will reflect what
their developers currently consider to be ready for general use in the
NVL.  In contrast, in a "full devel" checkout, these submodules will
reflect their latest versions (their main development branch heads).

Generally, you will only want the "full devel" checkout if you intend
to make changes to a submodule that you want to be able to easily
propagate back to its repository, for example, via a push.  

To do a regular "devel" checkout, run:

cd $NVL  # NVL top level directory
scripts/devel_checkout.sh

To do a "full devel" checkout, run:

cd $NVL  # NVL top level directory
scripts/full_devel_checkout.sh


Version Control Scripts
=======================

All source is managed using git.   For convenience, we provide several
scripts automate some of the more complex operations, particularly 
in regard to submodules.

scripts/update.sh              - update the NVL (pull)
scripts/full_update.sh         - update the NVL and submodules 
scripts/release_submodule.pl   - make submodule devel head become 
                                 default for NVL users
                                 (should be used only be submodule devels)

These scripts should be run from the NVL root directory.


Configuring, Building and Running
