Welcome to the NVL

To complete your checkout, first run either 
scripts/devel_checkout.sh or scripts/full_devel_checkout.sh.
The former is the default.   If you need more information
look at README.DEV.

To build the NVL for the first time, it is necessary to
do the following:

./configure
   This will ask you questions to determine the
   appropriate initial configurations for NVL components
   and will also create an appropriate build script.

./build
   This will build the NVL components and give you
   a bzImage and initrd that you can use to boot and
   run NVL.

./run
   This will run your build under QEMU (emulation)
   To run the build on your hardware, you will need
   to use the process for installing a new kernel
   or network booting a kernel (e.g. PXE) on it.

./clean
   This will restore the out-of-the-box experience
