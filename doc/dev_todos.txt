Things we need to do, possibly focus upcoming hackfest
on some of these items:

1. Kitten integration between Palacios and Kitten.
   Jack's Palacios tree has a module that creates
   Kitten kfs files to control/configure/manage
   Palacios VMs running on Pisces.  Kitten user-space
   can use these files to configure Palacios VMs.
   Port the kfs module to NVL tree.

2. Job launch.  Need a way to scalably launch app
   images and guest images on Titan.

3. Commit Jorge's I/O forwarding layer to Kitten.
   Currently this intercepts I/O related calls from
   Kitten user-space app, then forwards to a user-space
   daemon.  Daemon uses Portals4 to forward I/O request
   to Linux side.  Linux side uses Portals4 put/get directly
   to/from Kitten user-process.  On Pisces the daemon
   can probably be avoided and forward directly from Kitten
   kernel-space to Linux side.

4. Support for uGNI in Kitten user-level apps and Palacios
   guests.  Since we are using Pisces we can forward uGNI
   IOCTLs to Cray Linux.  This should minimize changes to
   uGNI driver.  Alternatively, we can mod uGNI driver to
   operate in "co-driver" mode, where it runs in each enclave
   and they know how to coordinate with each other.
