Note: This code will not build automatically. So please read on.

step1:  

Under guest directory there is  simple kgni stub driver. Please add this to <LINUX_KERNEL_SRC>/drivers. one
might need to add "+kgni" in Makefile chain as needed.

step 2: Above module will be built-in inside guest linux image. Once guest VM is up and connected to console
via STREAM  check and create the /dev entry. i.e:

/ # dmesg | grep kgni

fake kgni init called
guest kgni : major number of our device is 252
guest kgni : to use mknod /dev/kgni c 252 0
 kgni init succesful 252
/ # 
/ # mknod /dev/kgni0 c 252 0
/ # chmod 777 /dev/kgni0

Step 2: 

Look at simple test case under guest/sample-apps. This will simple do a open() and issue an ioctl() to above fake kgni
driver.


Step 3: 

Under host/palacios-changes  I have modified os_debug device, which registers two extra Hypercall 
and have associated handler. Above ioctl() on step2  from guest kernel will pass few parameters to Palacios VMM.

... more to be added
