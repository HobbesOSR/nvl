/**
 * GNI_MemRegisterSegments - Register memory segments with the NIC

 * IN

 * mem_segments List of segments to be registered. Each element of the list consists
 *              of the starting address of the memory region and the length, in bytes.
 * segment_cnt  Number of segments in the mem_segments list.
 * dst_cq_hndl  If not NULL, specifies the CQ to receive events related to the 
 *              transactions initiated by the remote node into this memory region.
 * flags        Memory attributes associated with the region
 *              (see GNI_MEM_xxx in gni_puh.h)
 * vmdh_index   Specifies the index within the pre-allocated MDD block that
 *              must be used for the registration, e.g. when set to 0 will
 *              use the first entry of the MDD block. If set to (-1) relies
 *              on GNI library to allocate the next available entry from
 *              the MDD block.
 *
 * INOUT
 * mem_hndl     The new memory handle for the region.
 *
 * Returns:
 * GNI_RC_SUCCESS - The memory region was successfully registered.
 * GNI_RC_INVALID_PARAM - One on the parameters was invalid.
 * GNI_RC_ERROR_RESOURCE - The registration operation failed due to
 *                         insufficient resources.
 * GNI_RC_ERROR_NOMEM - Insufficient memory to complete the operation.
 * GNI_RC_PERMISSION_ERROR - The user's buffer R/W permissions conflict with
 *                           the flags argument.
 *
 * Description:
 * This function allows a process to register a region of memory with
 * the Gemini NIC. The user may specify an arbitrary size region of memory,
 * with arbitrary alignment, but the actual area of memory registered will
 * be registered on MRT block granularity (or physical page granularity if
 * MRT is not enabled for this process).
 * To register a single segment GNI_MemRegister() function must be used.
 * Using multiple segments during the registration
 * imposes the requirement on an application to use an offset within
 * the registered memory region instead of a virtual address in all future
 * transactions where registered region is aligned to MRT block size (or page size
 * for non-MRT registrations).
 * A single segment memory registration should be a common way
 * an application registers its memory. A multiple segments registration
 * should be reserved for special cases.
 * A new memory handle is generated for each region of memory that
 * is registered by a process.
 * A length parameter of zero in any segment will result in a GNI_RC_INVALID_PARAM error.
 * If GNI_MEM_USE_VMDH flag is set, this function will fail if
 * GNI_SetMddResources has not been called to specify the size of the
 * MDD block to be used. If GNI_MEM_USE_VMDH flag is set, this function
 * will fail with GNI_RC_ERROR_RESOURCE return code if the vMDH entry
 * specified by vmdh_index is already in use.
 * The contents of the memory region being registered are not altered.
 * The memory region must be previously allocated by an application.
 * If failure is returned, the contents of mem_hndl are untouched.

 *
 * Description:
 * The GNI_CtPostFma() API allows a sequence of like typed FMA operations
 * to be combined into a single network transaction, resulting in the delivery
 * of a single completion event indicating the status of the entire
 * sequence.  Coalescing multiple FMA operations in this way can improve small
 * message rate performance.  Supported operation types are:
 *   - GNI_POST_FMA_PUT,
 *   - GNI_POST_FMA_GET, and
 *   - GNI_POST_AMO.
 *
 * All other operation types will return an GNI_RC_INVALID_PARAM error.
 *
 * The GNI_CtPostFma() API takes a standard gni_post_descriptor_t structure as a
 * parameter to describe the sequence of operations to perform.  The first
 * post descriptor in the sequence specifies the common fields which are used
 * by all transfers.  The following is the list of common fields used:
 *   - type,
 *   - dlvr_mode,
 *   - cq_mode, and
 *   - post_id.
 *
 * To set up multiple data transaction requests for the GNI_CtPostFma() API,
 * the user will need to create the first data transaction request using a
 * gni_post_descriptor_t structure.  Subsequent data transactions requests
 * will be created using a Chained Transaction post descriptor structure.
 * There is a different chained transaction post descriptor structure for
 * each supported operation type. The chained transaction post descriptors are:
 *  - gni_ct_put_post_descriptor_t for a FMA Put operation,
 *  - gni_ct_get_post_descriptor_t for a FMA Get operation, and
 *  - gni_ct_amo_post_descriptor_t for a FMA AMO operation.
 * The second data transaction request will be linked via the next_descr field
 * of the gni_post_descriptor_t structure.  Subsequent data transaction requests
 * will be linked via the next_descr field of the appropriate chained transaction
 * post desctriptor sstructure.  The last data transaction request must have
 * the next_descr field in the chained transaction post descriptor structure
 * set to NULL.
 *
 * The chained transaction post descriptor structures contain a subset of fields
 * from the gni_post_descriptor_t structure.  These structures contain only the
 * required information about a single data transaction request, which includes
 * the endpoint. Therefore, by using the chained transaction post descriptor
 * structures memory usage will be reduced.
 *
 * Since the GNI_CtPostFma() API can send requests to multiple endpoints, the
 * endpoint for the first data transfer request will be supplied as a parameter
 * in the GNI_CtPostFma() API call.  For all subsequent data transfer requests,
 * a valid endpoint must be included in the ep_hndl field of the appropriate
 * chained transaction post descriptor structure.   If a valid ep_hndl is not
 * speciied for each subsequent data transfer request, a GNI_RC_INVALID_PARAM
 * error will be returned to the application.
 *
 * The completion event will be sent to the src_cq_hndl for the endpoint
 * that is supplied as the parameter in the GNI_CtPostFma() API call.  The
 * remote completion id will be the remote event value associated with the
 * endpoint that is supplied as the parameter in the GNI_CtPostFma() API call.
 *
 * The maximum length allowed, the sum of all operations in the sequence, is 1 GB.
 * If this length is exceeded, then a  GNI_RC_SIZE_ERROR will be returned.
 * However, if the Communication Domain is configured with FMA_SHARING mode, then
 * the maximum length allowed, the sum of all operations in the sequence, is 1 MB.
 * If this length is exceeded, then a  GNI_RC_SIZE_ERROR will be returned.
 *
 * A GNI_DLVMODE_ORDERED_TAIL delivery mode is not supported and a
 * GNI_RC_INVALID_PARAM error will be returned.

 * required information about a single cqwrite transaction request, which includes
 * the endpoint. Therefore, by using the gni_post_descriptor_t structures memory
 * usage will be reduced.
 *
 * Since the GNI_CtPostCqWrite() API can send requests to multiple endpoints, the
 * endpoint for the first data transfer request will be supplied as a parameter
 * in the GNI_CtPostCqWrite() API call.  For all subsequent cqwrite requests,
 * a valid endpoint must be included in the ep_hndl field of the
 * gni_ct_cqw_post_descriptor_t structure.   If a valid ep_hndl is not
 * speciied for each subsequent data transfer request, a GNI_RC_INVALID_PARAM
 * error will be returned to the application.

 *
 * Returns:
 * 0   - Quiesce is not in progress
 * 1   - Quiesce is currently turned on
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * This is a private function available to Cray specific kernel
 * modules which need to query the quiesce state. Thus the unusual
 * return value.

/**
 * gni_get_errno - Return local CPU kgni errno value
 *
 * Parameters:
 * IN
 * nic_hndl     Handle of the associated Gemini NIC.
 *
 * OUT
 * errno_ptr    Pointer to the gni_errno_t structure to copy the local CPU GNI
 *              errno data into.
 *
 * Returns:
 * GNI_RC_SUCCESS       - GNI errno data was copied into the structre at errno_ptr.
 * GNI_RC_INVALID_PARAM - One of the parameters was invalid.
 * GNI_RC_INVALID_STATE - The local CPU GNI errno data has not been updated
 *                        since the last call to gni_get_errno().
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * This function returns extra information after certain kgni interface errors
 * occur on a CPU.  On initialization, each CPU's GNI errno data is invalid.
 * When a kgni public interface call returns an error, the local CPU's
 * gni_errno data could be set if the local CPU's gni_errno data is invalid.
 * When set, a CPU's gni_errno data must be invalidated with a call to
 * gni_get_errno() before new gni_errno data can be saved.  New errno data will
 * not be saved on the local CPU until this call is made.  Due to this, data
 * for the first kgni error (if several may occur in a single interface call)
 * will be saved in the local CPU's gni_errno data.
