Now client side is built as dynamic syscall interception librray which will intercept 
kgni open and ioctl() calls made by GNI_* functions from unmodified libugni.so 


Please see "examples" directory for a build in examples based on libugni calls:

e.g: "mem_reg"   below is an executable built from memory registration validation code in "examples" directory.


=========== This is to run a ugni example from after login to compute node: ==================================
