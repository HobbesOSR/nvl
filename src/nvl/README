This directory contains the source needed to build the nvl (Node Virtualization
Layer).  The build system creates a bootable kernel image that is intended to
be booted on the compute nodes of a massively-parallel distributed memory
supercomputer.  Each nvl instance manages a single compute node.

The nvl is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that allows multiple OSR (OS and
Runtime system) stacks to run simultaneously on a single compute node, where
each OSR stack runs as a separate "virtual machine" (VM).  The nvl provides
several types VM abstractions, including a full hardware VM that can run
unmodified guest OSR stacks, a para-virtualized VM where the guest OSR stack
cooperates with the nvl, and a "bare metal" lightweight Linux VM that emulates
a Linux environment for scalable HPC applications.  Unlike traditional VMMs,
the nvl includes a number of general-purpose mechanisms for composing separate
OSR stack VMs with one another, selectivly relaxing strict isolation. These
include a mmap-like interface for mapping memory regions between user-space
processes running in different VMs, a VMM-level name service and data store,
and a network-based API (Portals4) for inter-VM communication, both on and off
node.
